### Meet Ps-PHP
**Ps-PHP** stands for Procedural Slim PHP which is a framework that uses a procedural style. We use a procedural style to make it easier for beginners who are not familiar with OOP to develop a website quickly. In this framework, there are router, models, views, controllers, middlewares, and many more tools that are also found in other modern frameworks.


### Is Ps-PHP Right for You?
This framework is right for you if:
* You want a framework with non OOP style.
* You want a framework with small footprint.
* You are a beginner in PHP programming.
* Framework with different variations (If you are advanced).
